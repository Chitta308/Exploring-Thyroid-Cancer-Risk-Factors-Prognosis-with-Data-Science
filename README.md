# Exploring-Thyroid-Cancer-Risk-Factors-Prognosis-with-Data-Science

Thyroid cancer is a growing concern, and understanding its risk factors and prognosis can aid in early detection and better treatment outcomes. Using a dataset comprising 212,691 patient records, I analyzed various factors influencing thyroid cancer risk and survival.

🔍 Key Findings from the Data: ✔️ Risk Factors: Family history, radiation exposure, iodine deficiency, obesity, smoking, and genetic mutations (e.g., RET/PTC, BRAF).
✔️ Clinical Indicators: Tumor size, TSH, T3, and T4 hormone levels significantly correlate with thyroid cancer diagnosis.
✔️ Diagnosis & Treatment: Fine-Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB), ultrasound findings, surgery types, and radioactive iodine therapy play crucial roles in patient outcomes.
✔️ Survival Analysis: Patients with early detection and proper intervention have a higher survival rate, while factors like metastasis and recurrence impact long-term prognosis.

⚡ Data Science Approach: 📌 EDA & Visualization – Age distribution, gender-wise diagnosis, country-wise prevalence, and feature correlations.

📌 Machine Learning Models – I implemented Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost, achieving 82.49% accuracy in predicting thyroid cancer diagnosis.

🌍 This analysis underscores the power of data-driven healthcare solutions in identifying trends, predicting outcomes, and improving patient care.
